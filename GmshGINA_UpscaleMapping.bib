  abstract  = "In this paper we describe the OpenGeoSys (OGS) project, which is a scientific open-source initiative for numerical simulation of thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes
                in porous media. The basic concept is to provide a flexible numerical framework (using primarily the Finite Element Method (FEM)) for solving multifield problems in porous and 
                fractured media for applications in geoscience and hydrology. To this purpose OGS is based on an object-oriented FEM concept including a broad spectrum of interfaces for pre- and 
                postprocessing. The OGS idea has been in development since the mid-eighties. We provide a short historical note about the continuous process of concept and software development 
                having evolved through Fortran, C, and C++ implementations. The idea behind OGS is to provide an open platform to the community, outfitted with professional software-engineering 
                tools such as platform-independent compiling and automated benchmarking. A comprehensive benchmarking book has been prepared for publication. Benchmarking has been proven to be a 
                valuable tool for cooperation between different developer teams, for example, for code comparison and validation purposes (DEVOVALEX and CO2 BENCH projects). On one hand, 
                object-orientation (OO) provides a suitable framework for distributed code development; however, the parallelization of OO codes still lacks efficiency. High-performance-computing 
                efficiency of OO codes is subject to future research.",

  author   = "Bakdash, Jonathan Z and Marusich, Laura R",
  abstract = "Repeated measures correlation (rmcorr) is a statistical technique
              for determining the common within-individual association for
              paired measures assessed on two or more occasions for multiple
              individuals. Simple regression/correlation is often applied to
              non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce
              biased, specious results due to violation of independence and/or
              differing patterns between-participants versus
              within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr
              does not violate the assumption of independence of observations.
              Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because
              neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an
              intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common
              regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To
              make rmcorr accessible, we provide background information for its
              assumptions and equations, visualization, power, and tradeoffs
              with rmcorr compared to multilevel modeling. We introduce the R
              package (rmcorr) and demonstrate its use for inferential
              statistics and visualization with two example datasets. The
              examples are used to illustrate research questions at different
              levels of analysis, intra-individual, and inter-individual.
              Rmcorr is well-suited for research questions regarding the common
              linear association in paired repeated measures data. All results
              are fully reproducible.",

  abstract  = "Pearson's correlation measures the strength of the association
               between two variables. The technique is, however, restricted to
               linear associations and is overly sensitive to outliers. Indeed,
               a single outlier can result in a highly inaccurate summary of
               the data. Yet, it remains the most commonly used measure of
               association in psychology research. Here we describe a free
               Matlab((R)) based toolbox
               (http://sourceforge.net/projects/robustcorrtool/) that computes
               robust measures of association between two or more random
               variables: the percentage-bend correlation and
               skipped-correlations. After illustrating how to use the toolbox,
               we show that robust methods, where outliers are down weighted or
               removed and accounted for in significance testing, provide
               better estimates of the true association with accurate false
               positive control and without loss of power. The different
               correlation methods were tested with normal data and normal data
               contaminated with marginal or bivariate outliers. We report
               estimates of effect size, false positive rate and power, and
               advise on which technique to use depending on the data at hand.",

  abstract = "Directional data is ubiquitious in science. Due to its circular
              nature such data cannot be analyzed with commonly used
              statistical techniques. Despite the rapid development of
              specialized methods for directional statistics over the last
              fifty years, there is only little software available that makes
              such methods easy to use for practioners. Most importantly, one
              of the most commonly used programming languages in biosciences,
              MATLAB, is currently not supporting directional statistics. To
              remedy this situation, we have implemented the CircStat toolbox
              for MATLAB which provides methods for the descriptive and
              inferential statistical analysis of directional data. We cover
              the statistical background of the available methods and describe
              how to apply them to data. Finally, we analyze a dataset from
              neurophysiology to demonstrate the capabilities of the CircStat
              toolbox.",
